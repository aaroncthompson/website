# Aaron's Superawesome Website

Intro
-------
This is a repository for my website, domain name TBD. Probably just, like, my name.

Function
-------
This website is intended for three primary functions:
* To demonstrate my knowledge of fundamental coding skills, primarily through utilization of HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python and maybe even someday SQL!
* To demonstrate my understanding of good user experience design.
* To store my stuff, so I can show them to people without having to log into things.

Contents
-------
Contents will include information about myself, some projects (most likely of the gamedev variety), and maybe even a blog if my weird quirks about self-expression ever dissolve into the low-fat milk of self-importance (or is it confidence?).
